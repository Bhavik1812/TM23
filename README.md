Game - Homework


This is a commit for testing purposes. 


### Specs 

	- Use of incremental software delivery: We use Github
	- Use of Design patterns (Identify and write them down here )  
	- 



### First build 
	- GameEngine : tasks 
			- initialize the game state from a flat file( JSON with GSON is fast to work with )
			- have to moves and save another state to the same flat file 
			- has to know about all components:
				- model ( Player, Gameboard, Cards, Characters ) 
	- 


### How to contribute?
	- We are going to contribute to the code using ("pull-requests")[https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/]
	- The good way to do it was yo use all group members as contributors( having access to the repo ) but free version of github looks not to support that feature.
